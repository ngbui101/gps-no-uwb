     *   If the SSID is empty or not found, an error is logged and the method returns false.

     *   If this call fails, an error is logged and the method returns false.
     * - It waits up to 60 seconds for the WiFi status to become WL_CONNECTED.
     *   If the connection is not established within this timeout, an error is logged (suggesting a potential wrong password)
     *   and the method returns false.
